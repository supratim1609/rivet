# 🚀 Rivet Launch & Marketing Plan

## 🎯 Core Positioning
**"The High-Performance Backend for Flutter Developers"**

### The Hook (3.3x Faster)
Use the benchmark data as your primary attention grabber.
> *"Rivet is 3.3x faster than Express.js on dynamic routes. Stop compromising on performance when using Dart."*

### The Value Prop
1.  **Speed:** Beats Node.js/Express where it counts (dynamic routing).
2.  **Productivity:** Batteries included (Auth, Admin, DB, WebSockets).
3.  **Synergy:** Share code with your Flutter app. One language, end-to-end.

---

## 🤫 Phase 0: The Tease (Pre-Launch - NOW)
**Goal:** Build anticipation and curiosity before the code drops.

### 1. The "Benchmark Leak" (Twitter/Reddit)
Post the benchmark graph *without* the link yet.
> *"Been working on a new Dart backend framework. The dynamic routing performance is... interesting. 👀 3.3x faster than Express. Launching next week."*
> *[Attach Benchmark Image]*

### 2. "Building in Public" Thread
Share the story of *how* you optimized the router.
> *"I spent 3 days rewriting the router from Regex to a Trie-based implementation. Here's what happened to the requests/sec..."*
> *[Show Before/After stats]*
> *Developers love optimization stories.*

### 3. The "Admin Panel" Teaser
Post a 10-second video of the Admin Panel on LinkedIn/Twitter.
> *"Why install 5 different tools? Rivet comes with a built-in dashboard. Real-time metrics out of the box. #Flutter #Dart"*

---

## 📅 Phase 1: The "Loud" Launch (Week 1)

**Title:** *"I built a Dart backend framework that's 3.3x faster than Express.js"*
**Body:**
- Briefly explain *why* (tired of context switching).
- Show the benchmark graph/table immediately.
- Highlight the **Admin Panel** (screenshots work wonders).
- Link to repo and ask for feedback.
- **Goal:** 500+ GitHub Stars.

### 2. Product Hunt Launch
- **Tagline:** "The Full-Stack Dart Framework. 3x Faster than Express."
- **Gallery:**
    - Image 1: Benchmark comparison chart.
    - Image 2: Admin Panel screenshot.
    - Image 3: Code snippet showing how clean the API is.
- **First Comment:** Explain your journey and why you built it.

### 3. Twitter/X Thread

- **Tweet 2:** "⚡️ Performance: 3.3x faster than Express on dynamic routes. [Insert Benchmark Image]"
- **Tweet 3:** "🛠️ Built-in Admin Panel. No setup required. [Insert Admin Panel Video/GIF]"
- **Tweet 4:** "💙 Perfect for Flutter devs. Share your models. Type-safe end-to-end."
- **Tweet 5:** Link to GitHub.

---

## 📢 Phase 2: Content Marketing (Month 1)

### 1. The "Killer" Demo Video (YouTube)
**Title:** *"Build a Real-Time Chat App with Rivet & Flutter in 10 Minutes"*
- Show setup (1 min).
- Show WebSocket implementation (3 mins).
- Show Admin Panel monitoring (1 min).
- Show Flutter client integration (5 mins).

### 2. Technical Blog Posts (Medium/Dev.to)
- **Post 1:** *"Why I Ditched Node.js for Dart on the Backend"* (Controversial = Clicks).
- **Post 2:** *"How Rivet Achieved 3.3x Better Performance than Express"* (Deep dive into the Trie-router).
- **Post 3:** *"Full-Stack Type Safety with Rivet + Flutter"*.

---

## 🤝 Phase 3: Community & Ecosystem (Month 2+)

### 1. "Rivet for X" Templates
Create starter repos to lower the barrier to entry:
- `rivet-flutter-chat-starter`
- `rivet-ecommerce-api`
- `rivet-auth-template`

### 2. Discord Community
Start a Discord server for support. Be extremely active. Help people debug.

### 3. Partner with Flutter Influencers
Reach out to Flutter YouTubers/Tweeters. Ask them to review it.
> *"Hey, I built a backend framework for Flutter devs that beats Express benchmarks. Would love your thoughts."*

---

## 🖼️ Assets You Need

1.  **Benchmark Graph:** Visual bar chart showing Rivet vs Node vs Express.
2.  **Admin Panel GIF:** A 10-second loop showing the dashboard updating in real-time.
3.  **Architecture Diagram:** Simple visual showing Flutter <-> Rivet connection.

## ⚠️ Do's and Don'ts

- **DO** focus on Flutter developers. They are your tribe.
- **DO** be honest about benchmarks (you win on dynamic, lose on simple static).
- **DON'T** bash Node.js blindly. Acknowledge its ecosystem size, but highlight Dart's DX benefits.
- **DON'T** promise features you don't have.

**Success Metric:** 1,000 GitHub Stars in 3 months.

### Do:
✔ Be transparent about benchmarks (dynamic route wins).  
✔ Target Flutter developers first.  
✔ Post frequent updates (“building in public”).  
✔ Use short high-quality GIFs instead of long videos.

### Don’t:
✘ Don’t aggressively compare to Node/Express.  
✘ Don’t overpromise future features.  
✘ Don’t hide limitations (static routing, ecosystem size).
